Identity Ownership Management


We   intend   to   create   a   blockchain   dependent   system   which   would   facilitate   the   sensitive  
information   flow   between   the   consumer   and   such   companies   in   a   much   more  
sophisticated,   monitored   and   secure   manner.   This   would   help   in   identification   of   a   person  
without   sharing   of   any   sensitive   information,   and   the   consumer   themselves   have   the  
control over how much information they want to allocate to the company desiring it.  



First   and   foremost,   we   would   want   to   get   the   consumer   verified.   Thus,   we   would   create   a  
seperate   blockchain   for   every   individual.   For   this   purpose,   our   app   would   assign   double  
hashed   IDs   to   every   consumer   which   would   be   created   by   the   exact   hash   of   the   genesis  
block   of   that   person's   blockchain.   This   ID   would   be   presented   by   the   consumer   to   the  
company’s   representative   as   a   proof   of   his   identity.   Furthermore,   this   ID   would   be   entered  
by   the   company’s   rep   on   his   end,   which   would   instruct   the   government   servers   to   send   an  
OTP(one   time   password)   to   the   registered   phone   no.   of   the   consumer   and   that   OTP   has   to  
be   entered   by   the   company’s   rep   into   his   system.   Thus   if   the   OTP   is   entered   correctly   then  
the   consumer   is   labelled   as   verified   and   the   company   is   allowed   to   make   requests   for   the  
required   information   of   the   verified   consumer.   Thus   then,   the   consumer   would   have   the  
control   which   information   he   wants   to   share.   As   the   information   is   accessed   by   the  
company,   a   block   in   the   consumer’s   blockchain   is   created   consisting   the   details   of   the  
company and what exact personal details that company has accessed.
